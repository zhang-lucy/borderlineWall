<p>Hi I'm Gloria Lin '22! I study 6-3 Computer Science and live in McCormick Hall (actually home, now). Though my dorm room isn't as verdant as this,     it has a gorgeous view of the Charles River and Boston skyline, pictured here-- can you spot Prudential Tower? Outside of classes, I'm involved with Borderline (wrote this site hehe), Women in EECS,     The Tech (newspaper), and I UROP at the Media Lab. Fun fact: this room was inspired by the LoFi radio study girl. <br>    Catch Borderline at CP* Midway this Sunday! </p>
