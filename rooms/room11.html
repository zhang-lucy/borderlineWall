<p>Hello! I’m Joyce An, a ’22 majoring in Materials Science and Engineering. On campus I live in New House 3, but I’m currently back home in New Jersey. This room represents the vibrant flowering trees and green hills that I love about spring where I live: taking walks outside is definitely a source of joy in the midst of everything that’s happening. On campus, some things I’m involved in are Borderline as Co-Design Chair, a UROP in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Design for America, and Next Sing. I can’t wait to (virtually) meet more of you in the coming weeks! </p>
