<p>I'm Jenny Zhang and I'm a current sophomore majoring in design (4B) and minoring in cs (6)! This is a decently accurate representation of my room in East Campus:      I have a hanging loft, shelves, rainbow LED lights for ~lighting~, a spiky cat (hedgehog) that lives in the kiddie pool in the bottom left corner, and I'm a proud      plant mom! I live on a cat hall so cats will often hang around and chill (there's PJ my favorite cat sleeping on my loft). I am an animation chair in Borderline and      I UROP at the Media Lab with the Object Based Media Lab for Gender Affirming Makeup! I dye and cut hair for my friends, enabling them in self expression and becoming      a better version of themselves, and provide arts and crafts supplies and events for my dorm. I also love making all sorts of art (can art, wire art, 3D modeling, etc)      in my free time (and for design coursework) and you can follow my instagram @studio57crafts for updates! </p>
