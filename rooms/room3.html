<p>Hey, I'm Lucy Zhang ('21) and I study computer science (6-3) and statistics and I'm the Borderline financial chair. My room is inspired by my favorite quarantine activity, playing Mario Kart and other games on my Switch, and I imagine that Mario probably needs to social distance himself too during this time. I'm also in the Undergraduate Society of Women in Mathematics board as well as MIT Bridge Club and currently UROPing with CSAIL. </p>
