<p>Hi, I'm Nina, MIT '23! I live in East Campus and participate in a variety of extracurriculars, including firespinning, although I mainly spin rope dart. (The spirit in the room is holding a staff.) The inspiration for this room comes fantasy books, the machine shop I spent my FTC career inside, spinning arts, and East Campus. Safety safety safety!</p>
