<p>Hello! I'm Allan Gelman and I'm a 2020! I'm majoring in 21E, specifically combining Computer Science and Comparative Media Studies. 
    I made this room inspired by my favorite Studio Ghibli film, When Marnie Was There. Besides Ghibli, 
    I also love all sorts of other animation like Steven Universe, Pixar, and lots of anime (My Hero Academia is my current fav). 
    My involvements on campus include Borderline, MIT Admissions Blogging, and Arts Scholars. 
    I also just recently started an art-stagram, where I hope to start posting my various paintings/animations once I have more time after graduation! </p>
