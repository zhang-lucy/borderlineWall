<p>Hello, I'm Rachel, a freshman at MIT planning on majoring in 6-2 (EECS). I drew this room based on my dorm in Simmons--and yes, I really did have that many windows in my room! My involvements on campus include Borderline, MIT Hacking Medicine, MIT Premedical Society, and sport pistol team. I also spend a lot of time in my UROP at MGH!</p>
